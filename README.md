# SVHN-Digit-Classifier
Simple CNN to classify digits using the Street View House Number dataset. 
This project was submitted as part of Singapore University of Technology and Design's 2019 AI Challenge.

I used Keras to construct a simple CNN to classify the individual digits of the SVHN dataset. Highest accuracy achieved was 97.44%, without the use of a resnet or any augmentation policies, while being constrained to the Google Colab platform.
